# Large Language Models as a Research Accelerator: AI-Assisted Programming for Neuroscience

## Description

With the recent success of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, mastery of a programming language is no longer required to write successful code. In this tutorial, we will explore the new workflow of AI-assisted programming and how it can streamline your BrainHack project, no matter your coding experience.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

**those with a VUNetID can access ChatGPT at https://www.vanderbilt.ai**

**Otherwise, please create a [ChatGPT](www.chat.openai.com) account (comes with free trial), Microsoft Edge account (access only with Edge browser), or use another LLM of your choice.**

You will need the following framework to run this notebook:

- LLM account of your choice (see above)
- Python 3.9
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python libraries: numpy, nilearn, matplotlib, sklearn

### Installation

Example:

$ git clone [git@github.com:brainhack101/exploratory-data-analysis.git](https://github.com/brainhack-vandy/large-language-models-as-research-accelerator.git)
$ cd large-language-models-as-research-accelerator
$ pip install jupyter numpy scikit-learn nilearn matplotlib
$ jupyter-notebook
